All requests contain the following base URL:

```

## Authentication

For authentication, it's required to include a `x-api-key` header.

## Response codes

Supadata employs conventional HTTP status codes to signify the outcome of your requests.

Typically, 2xx HTTP status codes denote success, 4xx codes represent failures related to the user, and 5xx codes signal infrastructure problems.

## Rate limit

The Supadata API has a rate limit to ensure the stability and reliability of the service. The rate limit is applied to all endpoints and is based on the number of requests made within a specific time frame and your current subscription plan.

When you exceed the rate limit, you will receive a 429 response code.
