## Reasons and how to fix

### Supadata API key not provided

The error might occur if you haven't included the Supadata API key in your request.

To fix this:

1. Ensure you're including the Supadata API key in the request headers
2. Verify the header name is correct (`x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY` where `YOUR_API_KEY` is your API key from the dashboard)
3. Check if your API client is properly configured to send the key

### Invalid API key

The most common reason for this error is that the API key you're using is invalid.

To fix this:

1. Verify that you're using the correct API key
2. Ensure there are no extra spaces or special characters in the key

### Expired API key

Your API key might have expired.

To fix this:

1. Check your API key's expiration date in the [Supadata dashboard](https://dash.supadata.ai)
2. Generate a new API key if necessary
3. Update your application with the new key
