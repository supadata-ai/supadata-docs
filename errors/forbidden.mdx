Access to this resource is forbidden. This error occurs when Supadata cannot access the media URL you provided, typically due to expired access tokens or restrictive permissions on your storage.

## Reasons and how to fix

### Expired pre-signed URLs or tokens

The most common cause is providing a media URL with an expired access token or pre-signed URL. Services like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage use time-limited URLs for security.

To fix this:

1. Use publicly accessible URLs without expiration when possible
2. Generate pre-signed URLs immediately before making the API request
3. Set a longer TTL (Time To Live) on pre-signed URLs - we recommend at least 1 hour
4. Configure your storage bucket to allow public read access for media files

### Cloud storage permissions

Your media might be hosted on S3 or another cloud storage service with restrictive permissions that prevent our servers from accessing it.

To fix this:

1. Ensure your storage bucket allows public read access
2. Update IAM policies to allow external access to the specific media files
3. Test URL accessibility from a different network or device to confirm it's publicly accessible

### Social media content restrictions

Social media platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram may restrict access to certain content. Common scenarios include members-only content, private accounts, age-restricted videos, geographic restrictions, or deleted content.

To fix this:

1. Verify the social media content is publicly accessible without login
2. Ensure content isn't set to private, unlisted, or members-only
3. Test the link in a private/incognito browser window
4. If possible, download the media and host it on publicly accessible storage
