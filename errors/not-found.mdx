## Reasons and how to fix

### Resource doesn't exist or was moved

The most common reason for this error is that the resource you're trying to access (eg. YouTube video) doesn't exist, was deleted, or was moved to a different location.

To fix this:

1. Double-check the resource identifier (ID, URL, etc.)
2. Verify that the resource hasn't been deleted or moved to a different location
3. Ensure you're using the correct API endpoint

### Incorrect API endpoint

The error might occur if you're using an incorrect path to access the Supadata API

To fix this, review the API documentation for the correct endpoint structure and make sure you're using the correct path.
