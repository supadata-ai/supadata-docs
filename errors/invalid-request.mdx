It is an API error returned when the API fails to serve the request due to invalid request parameters.

```json
{
  "error": "invalid-request",
  "message": "Invalid request",
  "details": "Required parameters are missing from the request",
  "documentationUrl": "https://supadata.ai/documentation/errors/invalid-request"
}
```

## Reasons and how to fix

### Invalid request parameters

The most common reason for the `invalid-request` error is that one or more of the request parameters are invalid or missing.

To fix this, ensure that all required parameters are included in the request and that they are correctly formatted and valid.

### Missing required parameters

If required parameters are missing from the request, this will trigger the `invalid-request` error.

To fix this, ensure that all mandatory parameters are provided in the request. Refer to the API documentation for a list of required parameters.

### Incorrect data types

Providing parameters with incorrect data types (e.g., a string instead of an integer) can lead to this error.

To fix this, verify that the data types of all parameters match the expected types as specified in the API documentation.

### Parameter value constraints

Some parameters may have constraints on their values (e.g., minimum or maximum length, specific formats). Violating these constraints will result in this error.

To fix this, check the constraints for each parameter in the API documentation and ensure that the provided values comply with these constraints.

### Syntax errors

Syntax errors in the request, such as missing commas or brackets in JSON, can make the request invalid.

To fix this, carefully review the syntax of your request and correct any errors. Using a JSON validator can help identify syntax issues.
